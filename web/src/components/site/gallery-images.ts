// Central place to add hero/marquee images shown on the home page.
// How to use:
// 1) Drop your images into /public/gallery (create the folder if it doesn't exist)
// 2) List them here using absolute public URLs like "/gallery/your-file.jpg"
//    Next.js will serve these from the public/ directory.
// 3) Order matters; they'll scroll left in this sequence and loop.
